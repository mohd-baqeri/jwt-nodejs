# jwt-nodejs

We have two separate servers:
  1. For Authentication & Authorization (localhost:4000)
  2. For Viewing the Posts (localhost:3000)

The project includes a file called: request.rest that you can test the project with that...

in VSCode download an extension called REST CLIENT for testing your request.rest file
